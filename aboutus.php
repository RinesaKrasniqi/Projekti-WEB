      <h2 class="h-2">Doctor at My Dental Care</h2>
      <p class="p-2">Dr.Armuela</p>
      <p class="p-2-2">Works as a Dental hygienist or Dental therapist.I strive to offer culturally<br>
        empathic healing insight for each client that I meet. My approach is client centered<br>
        and I meet my clients and their families where they are at developmentally,<br>
        emotionally,and experientially. I work with my clients from a whole person approach,<br>
        and support them in whatever way that they need, in order to create a space where we 
        can utilize our time together to address whatever is holding them back and ultimately,
        to heal. I have great faith in the audacity of the human spirit to reveal what it 
        needs to in time, and to be ready to receive and celebrate the emerging gifts of 
        each client's experience.
        <br>
        <br>
        I believe that the relationships in my client's life matter in their work with me. I believe<br>
        that cultural empathy is a real skill, and being able to hold space for clients in this way<br>
        is particularly important to me.
